# Steam crawler

Do note that this readme will be updated later to include more information.

Please consider that you should not run your own instance of Steam crawler because there is already one being run and it doesn't give any benefit to run more. This code is here only for people to learn.

If you still feel the strongest desire to run Steam crawler, at least edit the settings and create some website to receive the data sent by the crawler.

The website for the one and only Steam crawler can be found here: [SteamBot](http://www.anttivainio.net/steambot)
